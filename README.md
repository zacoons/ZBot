# ZBot
A discord bot, so far it's only used in my community server. Feel free to make changes and do whatever you want with it...

How to run:
1. Go to key.py and paste your bot token
2. Just run app.py to bring the bot online

If you need help with anything, feel free to join my Discord server https://discord.gg/4ksWGps
